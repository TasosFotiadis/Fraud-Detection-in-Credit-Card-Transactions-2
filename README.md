# Fraud-Detection-in-Credit-Card-Transactions-2
In this project we are given a dataset of unlabeled credit card transactions and our goal is to detect whether the transaction is fraudelent (1) or legitimate (0). We will perform basic feature engineering, apply Machine Learning algorithms and methods and we will evaluate our detection results.
